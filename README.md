# Degen Gaming ERC20 Token Smart Contract
This repository contains the smart contract code for the Degen Gaming ERC20 token deployed on the Avalanche network. The Degen Gaming ERC20 token is designed to facilitate rewards, transfers, redemptions, balance checks, and token burning within the Degen Gaming platform.






## Contract Functionality
#Minting New Tokens :
The Degen Gaming platform's owner can mint new tokens using the mint function. This function creates and distributes tokens to players as rewards.

#Transferring Tokens :
Players can transfer their tokens to others using the transfer function. This allows for seamless token transfers between participants.

#Redeeming Tokens :
Players can redeem their tokens for in-game store items using the redeemTokens function. This feature enhances the in-game experience by allowing players to utilize their tokens.

#Checking Token Balance :
Players can easily check their token balance using the balanceOf function. This provides transparency and ensures players can monitor their holdings.

#Burning Tokens :
The burn function allows token holders to burn tokens that are no longer needed. This feature provides flexibility and helps maintain a healthy token ecosystem.
